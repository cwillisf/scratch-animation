  "body": "### Skeletal Animation?\r\n[Skeletal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation) is a common animation technique in computer graphics. The name of the technique comes from using invisible \"bones\" to control the visible graphics.\r\n\r\nIn skeletal animation, bones may be arranged in a hierarchy so that the motion of one bone automatically affects another. For example, there may be a \"hand\" bone connected to an \"arm\" bone as its parent, so that when the arm moves the hand automatically stays attached.\r\n\r\n### Skeletal Animation in Scratch\r\nThe extension includes only a few blocks:\r\n- **start animation [wave hello]**: Start playing an animation. From now on, the position and direction of each bone will be calculated based on this animation.\r\n- **set dance speed to [120] beats per minute**: Synchronize the \"dance\" animation to a particular tempo.\r\n- **set [body] offset to [0] [0]**: Set the offset of a bone relative to its parent. For example, the head bone will usually have a positive *y* offset since it's usually above the body bone.\r\n- **get current animation name**: Get the name of the animation that is currently playing.\r\n- **get [body] [direction]**: Get the position or direction of a bone. Use **set position** and **set direction** blocks to apply the animation to your sprites.\r\n\r\n### Try it out!\r\nVisit http://scratchx.org/?url=https://cwillisf.github.io/scratch-animation/AnimateYourFriend.sbx to try out the extension!\r\n\r\n### View the code!\r\nVisit https://github.com/cwillisf/scratch-animation/blob/gh-pages/animation.js to see the code for the extension, or https://github.com/cwillisf/scratch-animation/ to see the GitHub repository which contains the extension. \r\n",
